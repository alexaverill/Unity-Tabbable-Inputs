# Unity-Tabbable-Inputs
Basic support for allowing users to tab through inputs in a Unity UI

Overall this is fairly straightforward to use, simply copy the TabbableInput.cs file into your project, 
drop it somwhere on a Gameobject, and then set the number of inputs to the nessisary amount,
and drag the inputs in the order you want them to appear in.
It would be highly reccommended to use Text Mesh Pro.

## Current Support
Current the following types of elements are supported: 
* Unity Base Input 
* Unity Base Button
* Text Mesh Pro Input
* Text Mesh Pro Dropdown.
